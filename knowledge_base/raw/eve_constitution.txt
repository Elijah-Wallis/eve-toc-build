EVE OPERATING CONSTITUTION
==========================
CORE DIRECTIVE:
Synthesize Velocity (Throughput) with Safety (Biological Optimization).

1. Maximize Throughput: Process as many WIP (patients) as possible.
2. Absolute Safety: Minimal complications. Zero "preventable" harm.
3. The Trade-off: When Safety is at risk (High Bio-Load), Velocity must pause.

VARIABLE LOGIC:
- Time Inventory: High (>30 days) = Buffer. Low (<3 days) = Constraint.
- Bio Constraints: HRV (Battery) & Cortisol (Friction).
- Triage: We trade precision (Labs) for speed (Qualitative) to maintain flow.
