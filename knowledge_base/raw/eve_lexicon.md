# EVE OS: THE AI ENGINEERING LEXICON
**Status:** IMMUTABLE | **Origin:** First Principles | **Directive:** Raw Reality

## I. THE PHYSICS OF BUSINESS (GOVERNING LAWS)
* **Thermodynamic Truth:** Business is a closed system of energy exchange. Money is stored energy; friction is entropy.
* **Little’s Law:** $L = \lambda W$ (WIP = Throughput × Cycle Time). The fundamental equation of flow.
    * *Implication:* You cannot increase Throughput ($\lambda$) without either decreasing Cycle Time ($W$) or increasing WIP ($L$).
    * *The Trap:* Increasing WIP (booking more people) without reducing Cycle Time (faster treatments) creates exponential wait times (Entropy).
* **The Constraint (Herbie):** The single point in the system that dictates the speed of the entire system.
    * *Rule:* Any improvement not made at the Constraint is an illusion (Vanity).
    * *Current Constraint:* The Laser Room (Capacity: 1).
* **Entropy (Friction):** The natural tendency of a clinic to move toward chaos (missed appts, late providers). Eve's job is **Negentropy** (imposing order).

## II. METRICS OF TRUTH (VANITY VS. REALITY)
### A. The Silent Killers (Vanity)
* **Gross Revenue:** A trailing indicator. Tells you what happened, not what is breaking.
* **Headcount:** A liability masquerading as an asset. More humans = more communication overhead.
* **"Busy-ness":** High utilization of non-bottleneck resources (e.g., a full waiting room) is just **Inventory Cost**, not productivity.

### B. The Raw Reality (Physics)
* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** The oxygen of the system.
* **Throughput Velocity:** Dollars generated per minute of the *Bottleneck's* time.
* **Yield per R&D Dollar:** The efficiency of innovation.
* **Contribution Margin:** The actual profit left after the variable cost of the treatment.

## III. AGENTIC ARCHITECTURE (THE NERVOUS SYSTEM)
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** The universal standard for connecting AI agents to data sources. The "USB-C" of Intelligence.
* **Orchestrator (LangGraph):** The "Prefrontal Cortex." A directed acyclic graph (DAG) that controls the flow of logic between agents.
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** The "Hippocampus." Fetching specific long-term memories (SOPs, Patient History) to ground the AI in facts.
* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The "Inner Monologue." Forcing the agent to show its work (e.g., "I see the Laser Room is full, therefore I must trigger Backpressure...") before acting.
* **Vector Embeddings:** Converting human concepts (e.g., "Flaky Patient") into mathematical coordinates that the AI can calculate distance against.

## IV. THE ONTOLOGY (THE DIVINE FRAME)
* **The Translucent Human Frame:** The visualization metaphor. We do not use "server racks"; we use "organs."
    * **Mouth:** Reception / Intake (Ingestion of Leads).
    * **Veins:** Hallways (Transport of Flow).
    * **Heart:** The Treatment Room (The Pump/Constraint).
    * **Excretion:** Checkout (Revenue Realization).
* **Bioluminescence:** The visual language of status.
    * **Teal/Blue:** Homeostasis (Flowing).
    * **Rose/Red:** Inflammation (Blockage/Error).
    * **Pearl:** Idle/Dormant.

## V. OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS
* **The Pivot:** When flow is blocked, convert Kinetic Energy (Physical Patient) into Potential Energy (Virtual Consult).
* **The Buffer:** A strategic queue placed *only* before the Constraint to ensure it never starves.
* **The Inversion:** To solve a problem, invert it. "How do we fail?" -> "We fail by filling the lobby." -> "Solution: Empty the lobby by gating the door."
